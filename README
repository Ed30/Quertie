The project is a messaging app called Quertie. The idea came from the fact that we have all experienced this multitasking scenario : texting and walking at the same time.
In that case , we usually don't pay that much attention to what is going on around us. Therefore we thought : why not enabling the user to text and see what is around him at the same time.
In this repository there is also a presentational website of the app.
